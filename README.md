# simpleform

## How To Run it
1) install docker and docker-compose
2) in console ```docker-compose up```
3) in mongo-express [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) add new database 'simpleform'
4) now you can check the project [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


Problems:
    If docker can't run or new files have strange permision then check your uid and gid, if they are different from 1000 and 1000 tell me about that
